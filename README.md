# Custom Hashmap
## Project Description
My attempt at creating fast hashmap class (with a doubly linked list class), offering efficient key-value storage and retrieval.

Uses Closed Addressing with a Doubly-Linked List for collision resolution.

## Performance Test
The test contains of 90 Insertion, 90 Lookup and 90 Delete opretations.

The time took to finish those oprerations is measured.

The average time for each operation is calculated and displayed.
